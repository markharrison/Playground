## Create an API app

Create an empty directory.  With VSCode open the directory.

``` 
I am using .NET 8.0
I want to create a single API app.
I also need a MSTest unit test project.
What are the dotnet commands to scaffold a solution.  The files should be called "Color".
```

```
create colors model called ColorModel to include a name and hexcode.
```

```
create two API routes.
First - an API to return all colors.   Intialise with 3 colors - "red", "yellow", "black"
Sencond - an API to insert a new color.
I am using .NET 8.0  minimal APIs.

```

```
add hexcode validation
```

```
I want a validateHexCode function using Regex - i want in a static class called ColorUtilities.
Namespace should be Colors.API
```

```
what namespace to do I need for regex
```
